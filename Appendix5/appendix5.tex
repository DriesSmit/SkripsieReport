Validation and results of this system.

\section{Deep Convolutional Neural Network test results}
\label{sec:DCNNresult}

Accuracy for character recognition:

Using default deep neural network. Up to V22

Test accuracy for network trained on MNIST dataset:
On test data for MNIST: 		0.9935
On test data for generated digits: 	0.666667

Main reason for error.
The MNIST dataset has images that are more consentrated to being binary.
Either black or white.

Test accuracy for network trained on generated digits:
On test data for MNIST:			 0.9462
On test data for generated digits:	 0.921569


Reasons The algorithm above does not work that well on the characters:


Borders are not cut out properly.

Neural network focusses on color as well which decreases its accuracty for shape.
