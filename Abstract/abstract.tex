The aim of this research project is to develop software that automatically grades tests, written by students on a special template. The standard method used in these Optical Mark Recognition software, is to allow a learner to specify answers by colouring in bubble grids. To correct a mistake, the previous answer's bubbles must first be erased. This takes time and increases the probability that a learner might colour in the bubbles incorrectly. This research project tries to solve this problem by implementing additional software that eases the use of such a template. Using computer vision and two machine learning techniques, namely Neural Networks and Probabilistic Graphical Models, a student can now erase answers by crossing bubbles out and write answers using characters. The software developed in this project thus improves ease of use, compared to other OMR software, while maintaining a high level of grading accuracy.
