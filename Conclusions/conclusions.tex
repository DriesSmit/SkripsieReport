\section{Project summary}

In this project an automatic test grading system was developed with the aim of grading student test using a special template. Initially research was done into excising methods of grading these tests automatically. It was found that these software packages normally uses only image processing methods to grade bubbles on a paper. For this project additional machine learning capabilities were also built into the system. This allows for a better estimation of what the student  intended to write down on the paper.

\section{How this final year project benefits society}
In the African society there is a great number of individuals who does not have access to quality educational opportunities. The educational systems these individuals do have are normally not up to standard with limited teaching assistance. Educators who are available are not always accessible to learners to provide quality education. Automatic Mark Recognition software like the one developed in this project allows for a large number of tests to be assessed automatically and accurately in a short time span. This assists educators in handling bigger classes and thus provide more learners the opportunity for a better education.

\section{What the student learned}
During the execution of this project, the student learned that time management is important to complete a project of this scale. Time management also allows an individual to continuously asses how he/she is doing with respect to a schedule. This not only increases performance, but also self confidence in the final product. Finally, the student learned how to develop a software package in a professional environment. This project also allowed the student to gain a basic knowledge on a broad range of fields including image processing, neural networks and probabilistic graphical models. 


\section{Future improvements}

To increase the speed of grading tests it should be considered to use Stellenbosch's custom PGM library, implemented in C++W.By continuously updating the estimated orientation of the template as more bubble contours gets classified, accuracy in finding these bubbles can be increased. Further increases in test grading speed can be achieved by only doing image processing on the expected locations of the bubbles. This will bring some extra technical hurdles, but if solved can significantly increase the software's speed. Further the accuracy of the character recognition neural network can be increased by making use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to train the network on actually classified test results.

\section{Summary and conclusions}

For a tutorial setting with around 890 tests the system takes $\pm$ 30 minutes to grade these tests. This grading time is longer than other OCR software, but allows for a broader range answers to be given by a student. An example of these answers are the system's capability to identify a student number by only referring to the characters written in the student number box. The system has an overall accuracy of 97.1\%. An additional feature is implemented that transfers tests, which the system is uncertain about, to a user to manually grade. Cabined with the human operator, only 1 test in every tutorial session of an average of 890 tests gets graded incorrectly. In combination with the manually checked tests, the system thus obtains a 99.8\% accuracy on grading tests correctly.
